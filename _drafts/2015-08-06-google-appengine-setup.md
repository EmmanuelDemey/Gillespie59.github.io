A new blog post since a long long… very long time. I promise I will write articles more often than in the past. For this newborn, I will start with the first article of a serie about Google technologies. 

I have started last week a project in which I will use only Google technologies. It will help myself for learning new stuff. I won't explain what this application will be used for, I will let you discover with these blog posts (I want you to come back to my website ;))

What I have in mind for the moment, is an application using : 
- The Go language for the server-side, hosted on App Engine
- Angular2 and Material Design Lite for the front-end

If you have other ideas for the technical stack, do not hesitate to comment one of my posts, or create issues on the Github repository. I will be very glad to have a look to your ideas, and share what I learn with all of you. 

Let start with the beginning… with the quick configuration of my AppEngine instance, defined in a app.yaml file. 

The application will be composed of two parts : an REST API (implemented in Go) and an interface (using Angualar2). The UI part should be available at “/” and the API at “/api/”. In the configuration file of App Engine, I have to configure differents handlers based on an URL pattern. These handlers have to be defined in a handlers block in the app.yaml file. Here is the basic version of this file, defining the technologies of the application hosted on AppEngine. 


{% highlight yaml %}
application: xxxxxxx
version: 1
runtime: go
api_version: go1

handlers:
#handlers
{% endhighlight %}


Here is the description of these properties : 
- application : the ID of the application you have created on App Engine
- version : the version of your application
- runtime : The App Engine runtime needed for your application
- app_version : The version of the runtime

The first handler will define is for the REST API. We have to define two properties :
- url
- script

//TODO quel fichier go est utilisé ? 

{% highlight yaml %}
handlers:
- url: /api/.*
  script: _go_app
{% endhighlight %}

After implementing your API, if you launch your application with the goapp utility (og maybe another article about this command line tool ?), your API should be available !

So we have our API, let’s configure our static files (CSS, JS and HTML for the moment). We will define the same kind of configuration described previously. 

For each URL pattern (based on the file extension) , we will define at least three properties : 
- mime_types
- static_files
- upload

https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/appconfig#Python_app_yaml_Static_file_pattern_handlers

{% highlight yaml %}
handlers:
- url: /(.*\.css)
  mime_type: text/css
  static_files: static/\1
  upload: static/(.*\.css)

- url: /(.*\.js)
  mime_type: text/javascript
  static_files: static/\1
  upload: static/(.*\.js)

- url: /(.*\.html)
  mime_type: text/html
  static_files: static/\1
  upload: static/(.*\.html)

- url: /
  static_files: static/index.html
  upload: static/index.html
{% endhighlight %}


Of course, this configuration is not enough. You should add for every static file your App Engine instance has to serve, the corresponding configuration block (XML, font, …). 

And this first post is now drawing to a close. You should have now an up-and-running application you can deploy on App Engine. 

See you soon...
